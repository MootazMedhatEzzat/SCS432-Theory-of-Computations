## Assignment 2: DFA & NFA

Cairo University  
Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence  
Theory of Computations Course (Spring 2024) 

### üìã Instructions

- **‚è∞ The deadline for submission is on Tuesday, 23/4 at 11:59 pm**.
- Submission will be on Google Classroom. No late submission or email submission is allowed.
- Please submit one compressed folder with the `.java` files and a PDF file. The folder name should follow this structure: `STUDENT-ID_GROUP.zip`.
- In case of cheating, you will get a negative grade whether you give the code to someone, take the code from someone/internet, or even send it to someone for any reason.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Solve all the 10 problems.
- For each problem, you should submit the drawn FSA and Java code that solves it.
- For all problems, write in Java Language.
- Submit a PDF file that contains the drawn DFA or NFA for the problems.
- The Java program will take ONE input text file containing the input values for each problem. The program must save the output of each problem in ONE output text file following the required format for each problem.

### üì• Input file

Starts with the number of the problem, followed by the input values for the problem, then ‚Äúend‚Äù to indicate the input for this problem is finished and to move to the next problem.

### üìÑ Output file

Starts with the number of the problem, followed by the corresponding output values of the input for the problem, then ‚Äúx‚Äù to indicate the output for this problem is finished and to move to the next problem.

### DFA

Simulate a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA):

- The DFA's states
- The alphabet
- The transition function
- The start state
- The set of accepting states

### NFA

Simulate a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA):

- The NFA's states
- The alphabet
- The transition function
- The start state(s)
- The set of accepting states
