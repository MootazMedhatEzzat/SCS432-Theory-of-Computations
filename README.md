## Assignment 2

Cairo University  
Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence  
Theory of Computations Course (Spring 2024) 

### Assignment 2: DFA & NFA

### Instructions

- The assignment must be completed in groups of 2 to 4 students from the same lab or with the same TA.
- Submission deadline: Tuesday, 23/4 at 11:59 pm.
- Submit your work on Google Classroom. No late submissions or submissions via email will be accepted.
- Your submission should be a compressed folder containing all necessary .java files and a PDF file. The folder name should follow the format: ID1_ID2_ID3_ID4_GROUP.zip
- Any form of cheating, including sharing or taking code from others, will result in a negative grade. This includes giving, receiving, or sending code for any reason.

### Requirements

1. **Solve all 10 problems**.
2. For each problem:
   - Draw the corresponding DFA or NFA.
   - Write Java code that solves the problem.
   - Submit a PDF file with the drawn DFA or NFA for each problem.
3. The Java program must handle:
   - **Input File**: Starts with the problem number, followed by the input values for the problem, and ends with "end" to indicate the end of input for that problem.
   - **Output File**: Starts with the problem number, followed by the output values for the input, and ends with "x" to indicate the end of output for that problem.

### Submission Details

- Ensure that the Java code files are named clearly and organized.
- The PDF should include all DFA or NFA diagrams with clear labels.
- The input and output files should adhere to the specified format.

### Grading Criteria

The assignment will be graded based on the following:
- **Accuracy and Completeness of Solutions**: 40%
- **Correctness of Java Code**: 30%
- **Clarity and Organization of Documentation**: 20%
- **Adherence to Submission Guidelines**: 10%

Total marks: 100 (will be scaled as per course requirements).
