### Instructions

- The assignment is submitted in groups of 3 students from the same lab or the same TA.
- The deadline for submission is on Saturday, 23/3 at 11:59 pm.
- Submission will be on Google Classroom. No late submission or email submission is allowed.
- Please submit one compressed folder with the `.java` files. The folder name should follow this structure: `ID1_ID2_ID3_GROUP.zip`.
- In case of cheating, you will get a negative grade whether you give the code to someone, take the code from someone/internet, or even send it to someone for any reason.

### Requirements

- Solve all the 10 problems.
- For all problems, write a Java program to solve them using regular expressions by following the expected input & output format for each problem.
- The Java program will take ONE input text file containing the input values for each problem. The program must save the output of each problem in ONE output text file following the required format for each problem.

### Input file

Starts with the number of the problem, followed by the input values for the problem, then “end” to indicate the input for this problem is finished and to move to the next problem.

### Output file

Starts with the number of the problem, followed by the corresponding output values of the input for the problem, then “x” to indicate the output for this problem is finished and to move to the next problem.
